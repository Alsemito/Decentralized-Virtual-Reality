We are Xavi Marzo (240134), Dario Hernández (230124), Camila Almada (229891), and Àlex Serrano (230278) and this is our Blockchain project. 

In this repo you will find:

1. The PDF of the project (report).
2. A 20-minute video explaining the project, with a walkthrough of the code and a simulation of its functionalities.
3. The code used for the implementation.
